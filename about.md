### Scott Lougheed 
{: style="text-align: center;"}

#### As an academic:  
I am an environmental social scientist. Most recently I was a postdoctoral fellow in Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto. Prior to that I was a visiting scholar in the department of Agricultural Economics, Sociology, and Education at the Pennsylvania State University. I earned my PhD from the School of Environmental Studies at Queenâ€™s University, Kingston. I also hold Master's (Queen's University) and Bachelor's (University of Victoria) degrees in Sociology.

My primary interests lie in two domains: environmental governance, particularly with respect to waste and consumption; and the biopolitics of the food system. 

I am also interested in the development of community and communal spaces. I am particularly interested in models of collective ownership and sharing as a means of reducing consumption (and thus, waste), community capacity-building and empowerment, and social justice. 


#### As a human:  
I am an enthusiastic cook and bread baker, a freelance sound engineer, and am slowly learning how to develop software.
