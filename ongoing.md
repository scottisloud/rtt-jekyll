### Food Security and Secure Food in the Anthropocene
This is a paper for a special issue of *Crime, Law, and Social Change: An Interdisciplinary Journal* called "Lessons of the Anthropocene - Entanglements and Security"

### Dissertation
I am continuing work on my dissertation for my PhD in Environmental Studies of which the above paper is one part. I am currently analyzing interview and documentary data while writing the "Food Security and Secure Food" manuscript.

### Learning PHP and SQL
When I can't sleep I'm learning PHP and mySQL. This is mostly maintain a diverse set of skills. I am also very interested in the web and software development, and PHP and SQL seem like reasonable places to getting my foot in this door as a hobby. Additionally, as someone pursuing a career in research, managing data of all kinds is imperative and the idea of homegrown methods for managing data of all kinds is compelling. Likewise with building and controlling my own web presence.

### CSS and HTML
As part of learning PHP and SQL I spent no small amount of time on HTML and CSS. Having now obtained an intermediate level of competence in these domains I am regularly trying out small front-end web exercises to practice and hone my use of these languages. One such example is the hand-coded replication of my original Squarespace blog which you can see at <http://transition.scottlougheed.com> (mobile and desktop versions).
