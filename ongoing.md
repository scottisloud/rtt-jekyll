## Research Projects

#### Consumers in Extended Producer Responsibility
This project examines the role of the consumer under the present and soon-to-be-replaced extended producer responsibility system in Southern Ontario.

#### Proteinization and Proteinscapes in the Anthropocene
This project considers how the current emphasis on protein and the valourization of animal protein in particular in the diets of a growing number of consumers intersects with the current rapidly growing array of "new proteins" (plant, insect, and in vitro). The North American “proteinscape” is in flux, and along with these new proteins come possible discursive fault lines. As such new proteins serve as a vector through which to query the various ways sustainability and ethics are defined, and the future discursive struggles new proteins may be ushering in. The central question of this study is what types of discursive struggles emerge in and constitute the dynamics of the proteinscape of the Anthropocene? Parts of this project are being conducted in conjunction with the Plant-based Proteins Research and Teaching group at the Pennsylvania State University.

## On the side

#### Learning Swift
I'm currently learning how to write applications for Mac and iOS with the eventual hope of being able to develop applications and tools to help academics.
