title: Thinking Critically about the Circular Economy

There are already some interesting examples of the circular economy at work. One examples is a family-run bottled water company in Ontario. Their bottles are made from 100% recycled plastic which they purchase in bails from municipalities and materials recovery facilities. These bails, however, include bottle lids, which cannot be used to make new bottles. To prevent those lids from going to landfill, the company sells those lids to a company that converts them into adarondack chairs.

On the face of this it is a pretty great and creative little solution to a problem. What was missing from this discussion was thoughtful consideration about whether the two products in question — bottled water and recycled plastic adarondak chairs — are products that should exist in their present form, or at all.

And this is a part of the circular economy discussion that seems to be broadly underdeveloped in academic and non-academic discussions about the topic. We need to carefully consider what products we actually choose to produce at all, whether that production is "circular" and "closed loop" or not.

The loop of plastic water bottles being reused to make more plastic water bottles plus chairs is predicated on our acceptance of bottled water as a product in the first instance.

Ostensibly, the point of a circular economy is to eliminate waste by ensuring all materials stay in systems of production (for as long as possible, at least).
