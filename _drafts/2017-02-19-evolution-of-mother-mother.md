The Canadian "indie"/"alt"/"rock" band [Mother Mother][MM] released their sixth album, _No Culture_ on Friday, February 10th. While discussing _No Culture_ with a friend who has shared a similarly strong appreciation for the band, she disclosed that this record was yet another disappointment following the equally disappointing _Very Good Bad Thing_, released in 2014. While I agreed _Very Good Bad Thing_ was a bit of a miss, I felt much more positively about _No Culture_.

We both concluded that there has been a significant musical shift with the release of _Very Good Bad Thing_, with _No Culture_ being a continuation down that shifted trajectory. While my friend found this new direction to be unpleasant and diverging harshly from the band's earlier sound, I perceived the move less negatively and less drastic.

This got me wondering what had actually changed? What was the band doing differently? Is _Very Good Bad Thing_ the turning point my friend and I perceived it to be, or was this part of a longer, less seismic shift that spanned several albums?

I decided to take a careful listen to the Mother Mother discography, paying attention to their choice of instrumentation, sound or tone, musical arrangement, and the broader production attributes. Music is made up of much more than these things, but these are usually what I personally pay attention to in music, and typically what determine what I do or do not like. Alas, this is a product of my background as a (not-formally-trained) musician and formally trained sound engineer, so this is the angle I'm taking. My intention is to look at where these aspects of Mother Mother's music started to shift and what the character of these shifts were, and what has remained consistent across their discography.

Here's an overview of their discography:

* Touch Up (February 27, 2007, Last Gang Records)
* O My Heart (September 16, 2008, Last Gang Records)
* Eureka (March 15, 2011, Last Gang Records)
* The Sticks (September 18, 2012, Last Gang Records)
* Very Good Bad Thing (November 4, 2014, Island Records/Universal Music Canada)
* No Culture (February 10, 2017, Island Records/Universal Music Canada)

Let's begin with some general comments about Mother Mother's music. Across their discography there are some things that have remained constant:

The band is a five-piece, consisting of one guitarist, two keyboard players, a bassist, and drummer (with some of these musicians switching around to play other instruments from time to time). Vocals are performed by three of the band members: the two female keyboard players and the male guitarist. In some cases the male vocalist does not sing and the two female vocalists share lead vocal roles (For example on the song "Sleep Awake" from _O My Heart_).

Every record they've released sounds absolutely stunning. They have modern, immaculate, "glossy" production. Stand-out attributes include: very modern and clean acoustic drums; layered vocals, usually including multi-part harmonies; acoustic and electric guitar, often layered, often double- or triple-tracked [^Double-tracking or triple-tracking refers to a recording technique where the same part is recorded several times and layered on top of itself, sometimes with each "take" panned across the stereo image. It is very common for lead vocals to be double-tracked with both takes panned centre giving a "chorus"-like effect, or for a rhythm guitar to be double-tracked and each take panned hard left and right to take up more "space" and usually sound fatter or "heavier".]. There's usually a single lead vocal track with multiple background vocal tracks spread across the stereo field.


First there are some things to get out of the way. _Touch Up_ is a bit of an outlier. It was originally released independently and eponymously under the band's former monicker Mother in 2005. It was subsequently re-released on Last Gang Records with two newly added songs as well as some production "touch ups" (get it?) such as re-tracking some parts and some additional overdubs. As such, _Touch Up_ is a bit of an outlier in some respects. The production
