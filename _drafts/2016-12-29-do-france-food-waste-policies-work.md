title: We don't know if France's food waste policies work

Earlier in 2016, France enacted a suite of policies intended to reduce food waste and food insecurity. These policies target multiple sectors, such as legal requirements that retailers to donate unsold food to charities, educational programs for schools, and elimination of "best before" dates on certain products. Taken together, these policies set a high bar for what countries could potentially do to reduce food waste and hunger (though I am skeptical of notion that [hunger is a waste issue][cp] and the [effectiveness of charities in reducing hunger and food insecurity][fb]). [An article in Connexion France][cf], citing a report published by the Barilla Centre for Food and Nutrition on their [Food Sustainability Index][FSI], claims that France is "the best in the world for its efforts to cut down on the amount of food people and supermarkets throw out". The [whitepaper][FSI whitepaper] that the Connexion France article cites is equally full of praise:

>The world is watching, says Craig Hanson, global director of food, forests, and water at Washington’s World Resources Institute. France has implemented a “multi-sectoral, multi-modal approach in trying to tackle a complicated issue. It is, by definition, pioneering because no other country has anything like it on the books,” he says.

Indeed these "pioneering" policies have earned France the top spot on the Food Loss and Waste "pillar" of the report.
I agree wholeheartedly with the praise France gets for *implementing* the most robust food waste policies to date.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">France model is best worldwide for reducing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/foodwaste?src=hash">#foodwaste</a>-national strategies work! <a href="https://t.co/8BIjVLFdXR">https://t.co/8BIjVLFdXR</a></p>&mdash; Paul van der Werf (@allfoodisfood) <a href="https://twitter.com/allfoodisfood/status/814474930947555328">December 29, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, can we assume, as Connexion France and other commentators have, that earning top ranks in the Food Loss and Waste pillar means that those policies are actually *working*?
According to that very same FSI whitepaper:

>It is still too early to judge the impact of the food-waste law.

This statement very sensibly suggests that while there are a lot of policies targeting a lot of sectors, we have no data that suggests the effectiveness of these groundbreaking policies.

So no, we actually have no idea if these policies are working. Certain individuals in the report provide anecdotes that suggest it might be working, but there is no evidence in the Connexion France article, nor in the report, nor in the original data, to indicate that these pioneering policies are reducing food loss and waste. In fact, while France may be a leader in terms of food waste policies, the FSI data supporting the 2016 whitepaper show that France's food loss and waste as a percentage of food production is greater than Canada, the USA and Australia (data appears to be from 2011).

Absolutely France is a leader in food waste policy. Absolutely France should be lauded for making food waste a priority and for targeting upstream actors as much as downstream actors. However, to say that these policies are working is to jump the gun. I think we should be optimistic about these policies, but we have no idea if these policies will work, and we shouldn't say that they are until there is evidence to support that claim.
