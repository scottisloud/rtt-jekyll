title: Keeping Focus

I have difficulty keeping focused on difficult or challenging tasks. This is particularly true when the task has little, or very deferred gratification, such as writing journal articles or dissertations or book manuscripts. While I know most people struggle to some extent with focused work, I like to think that I am particularly distractible, especially given my avoidant tendencies in the face of anxiety or stress. Writing is particularly difficult for many people because writing is rarely an "on demand" activity that we can dive easily in and out of. It is very easy to hit a wall with your writing, decide to look something up on Amazon, and before you know it it's dinner time. Often with writing it is exactly the moment you hit a wall that you need to stick with it (but sometimes it's exactly the moment you need to take a walk or do some exercise, either way it is about being intentional). While, of course, there are moments where you are better to take a break and clear your head, this post outlines my relatively recently-honed strategy for keeping focus and endurance. I find I am less prone to distraction and more persistent when confronted with small writing hurdles that merit perseverance rather than head-clearing.

Essentially there are two main components: 1) a sort of "mode" to help me stay focused on the specific task at hand; and 2) a set of strategies for dealing with inevitable mind-wandering and distracting thoughts. I'll detail those in that order.

## Staying Focused
### Pomodoro Technique
The foundation of me staying focused is to balance steady work with moments of head-clearing. The Pomodoro Technique has been immensely helpful in achieving this balance. If you aren't familiar, the Pomodoro Technique involves alternating between periods of work and brief break periods. Once you have done four work periods, you do a longer break. I usually do 25 minutes of work with 5 minutes of break. My long breaks are 20 minutes long. This timing aligns with original Pomodoro technique. For every hour that passes I end up with 50 minutes of continuous work. You can tweak these to your liking, and some tasks may require longer work intervals, but 25/5 works well for me.

Now, I don't follow this too religiously, so sometimes my short break is as long as it takes me to make a cup of coffee, rather than 5 minutes. I also take a break as long as is required for lunch, which usually exceeds my 20 minute "long break". Sometimes I will even forgo my long break if I'm on a roll or if I know lunch is coming up after a few work sessions.

### Ambient Music with a dash of mindfulness
I listen to ambient music, at least during my working periods, and sometimes during my break periods. The ambient music helps in a number of ways. It helps drown out external auditory stimuli that might momentarily divert my attention, what some might call an "sonic screen". This is particularly helpful if you are working in a shared space.

The second way that ambient music helps is by giving me an anchor to which I can direct my attention if I find my mind wandering. This is where some basic mindfulness principles come into the system. Every now and then my mind will drift, daydream-like, to something that is not related to the task at hand and not related to anything necessarily actionable or resolvable. When I find my mind drifting in this direction, I'll bring myself back to the present by bring turning my attention, briefly, to the music and re-centre my focus.

As for music selection, the type of music matters a great deal. The music can't have any words or percussion and limited overall transients (any percussion like sounds). Melodies should also be as minimal as possible. The gateway album, I think, is Brian Eno's *Ambient 1: Music For Airports*. As Brian Eno said of that album, the music should be ["as ignorable as it is interesting"](http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/MFA-txt.html).

What I find is that the music almost disappears while I'm working. I hardly notice it. The only times I really take note is when I bring myself back from a daydream by turning my attention to the music. Once I'm back into a work groove, the music disappears.

I've put together an Apple Music playlist that should provide you basically a full work day's worth of ambience. Some of the songs are borderline too complex, but most of them work well for me.

## Dealing with Distracting thoughts
### Make a List and Defer Distraction
We are often inclined to try and avoid distracting (or negative) thoughts or feelings, which of course is a nearly-impossible task. Those of us who are easily distractible are also inclined to fall down a rabbit hole led by those thoughts thoughts or feelings the moment they are experienced.

Rather than try and avoid these thoughts altogether during work periods, I try and
