I"8<p>This website is created using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is great for making simple, static websites like this one. Jekyll makes composing new posts super easy since posts are just basic markdown files. What does take a bit of effort is actually publishing a post. I run Jekyll locally, so there is no “publish” button I can just press and let loose my words on the world like users of fully hosted CMS (e.g., Wordpress) can. Every time a Jekyll site is modified it needs to be rebuilt and the modified files uploaded to the server.</p>
