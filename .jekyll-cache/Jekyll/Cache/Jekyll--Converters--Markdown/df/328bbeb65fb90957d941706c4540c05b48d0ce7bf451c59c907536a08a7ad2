I"¸<p>The CBCâ€™s Marketplace is focusing on retail food waste this week. Yesterday we heard from a former Walmart contractor that  <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/walmart-food-waste-go-public-1.3813162">a â€˜heartbreakingâ€™ amount of food is trashed every day</a>. Today, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-walmart-food-waste-1.3814719">Marketplace reveals its findings from 12 days of sifting through Walmart dumpsters</a>.<br />
This is a great scoop for the CBC and I think this kind of coverage is just what is needed to bring light to a shameful problem. Food retail accounts for 10% of the food wasted in Canada. This is a small slice of the pie, but in absolute terms, itâ€™s a substantial amount of food (it is, after all, a very big pie). These CBC stories can stand on their own, but I wanted to add some additional commentary and nuance based on some of my experience and research on food waste.</p>
