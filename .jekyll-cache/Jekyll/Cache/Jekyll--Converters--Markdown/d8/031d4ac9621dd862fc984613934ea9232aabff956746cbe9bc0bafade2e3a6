I"Ü<p>For some reason this particular recall is trending on Facebookâ€¦ this is the first time Iâ€™ve ever seen that happen. Interestingly, <a target="_blank" href="http://globalnews.ca/news/2108952/some-stuffed-chicken-products-recalled-due-to-possible-salmonella-contamination/">some news reports</a> are highlighting the fact that it was prompted by a â€œrecall in another (undisclosed) countryâ€. It takes about 5 minutes to find out that the country is the USA, and that this is actually just a second wave of an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2015/07/barber-foods-recalls-kiev-stuffed-chicken-for-possible-salmonella-contamination/">earlier recall from July 2nd</a> that didnâ€™t extend to Canada.Â </p>
