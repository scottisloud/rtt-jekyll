I"–<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/food-poisoning-information/68-sickened-by-salmonella-sprouts-but-no-recall/#.VHcTIIu5dSV">Food PoisonÂ Journal</a>Â asks â€œ68 Sickened by Salmonella Sprouts, but No Recall?â€. This is an interesting question. At first glance, I was dismayed too. Why on earth, with nearly 70 cases, wouldnâ€™t Wonton foods recall their bean sprouts.Â </p>
