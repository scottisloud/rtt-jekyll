I"F<p>Hot on the tail of the massive caramel/sliced apple recall that has affected <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2015-01-09/eng/1420849646175/1420849647112">Canada</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/12/carmel-apples-linked-to-listeria-outbreak/#.VLkSfsk950s">US</a>, a new set of cascading recalls seems to be spreading. This time the culprit is undeclared peanut allergen in cumin powder which has prompted <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm429688.htm">recalls of cumin itself</a> along with over <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm429688.htm">50 other brands</a> covering a variety of spices and prepared products including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/food-recall/more-meat-recalled-over-peanuts/#.VLkI_sk950s">some prepackaged meats.</a></p>

<p><span>Ingredient recalls really demonstrate </span>the interesting dynamic of the global industrial food system. It is in these cases where a single point of failure with a single product can branch out and spread, resulting in a recall many times the size of the original contamination. While it hasn’t spread to Canada yet, it will be interesting and unsurprising if it eventually does. </p>
