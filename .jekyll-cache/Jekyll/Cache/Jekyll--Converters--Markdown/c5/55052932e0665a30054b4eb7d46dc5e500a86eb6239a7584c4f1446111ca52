I"¹<p>Itâ€™s been over a year since I last updated this site. A lot has changed. The number of ruby gems I needed to reinstall, disable, or swap, just to build this website again is a sign of the extent of my neglect.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many other much less important indicators of the passage of time such as: my academic career stalling out; spending a quite some time time unemployed; moving between countries (back to Canada ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦, yay!); establishing a totally new career; and landing on my feet with a whole new life trajectory and career path.</p>

<p>I know my large, devoted audience has been eagerly awaiting updates on my personal life and are in dire need of guidance from my renowned thought leadership. Worry not, masses, your appetite for my knowledge nuggets will soon be sated.</p>

<p>I have some decisions to make about the design of website, which was conceived while I was an academic and at a time where seemingly random strings of letters (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p h d</code>) held meaning. With that in mind, my massive hoard of valued readers, donâ€™t be afraid if you see some minor redecorating going on.</p>

<p>In the meantime I hope youâ€™ll enjoy a tall glass of raw water while listening to a guided â€œmeditationâ€ on one of the eight mindfulness applications you installed on your phone yesterday when decided on a whim that youâ€™d like to seek an elevated state of enlightenment.</p>
