<p>Allergen labels are immensely important in ensuring the safety of customers with allergies. No doubt there needs to be close monitoring to ensure that consumers with allergies can shop with confidence. Customers with allergies arenâ€™t dummies. This recall is borderline insulting.</p>

<p>Either that or itâ€™s a scary sign of just how far processed food has come and that consumers have now been trained to know that just because the label says the product is â€œnuts and yogurtâ€ doesnâ€™t mean it contains either of those things.</p>
