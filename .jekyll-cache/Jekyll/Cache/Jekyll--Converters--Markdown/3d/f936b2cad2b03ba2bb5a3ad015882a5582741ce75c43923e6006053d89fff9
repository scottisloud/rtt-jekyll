I"Š<p>Stericycle this month published their <a href="http://www.stericycleexpertsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/STCExpertSOLUTIONS-IndustrySpotlight-US-Q22016-FINAL.pdf">Q2 report on product recalls in the United States</a>, which theyâ€™ve called â€œTainted Tableâ€. I love these quarterly reports from Stericycle, and I think this one has some interesting bits worth highlighting.</p>
