I"m<p>Health Canada recently announced a <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/legislation/acts-reg-lois/frp-ppr/2016-2018/beef-irradiation-boeuf-eng.php">regulatory initiative</a> which would allow beef processors to sell irradiated ground beef. I was invited to speak to <a href="http://www.newstalk770.com/kingkade-and-breakenridge/">Calgary’s Kingkade and Breakenridge on NewsTalk 770</a> about what this initiative might mean. The interview went well, and Rob and Roger are both thoughtful and insightful radio hosts, but there was a lot that didn’t get covered. I’ll expand on some of those thoughts here.</p>
