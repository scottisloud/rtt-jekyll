I"Ú<p>Stericycle this month published their <a href="http://www.stericycleexpertsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/STCExpertSOLUTIONS-IndustrySpotlight-US-Q22016-FINAL.pdf">Q2 report on product recalls in the United States</a>, which they‚Äôve called ‚ÄúTainted Table‚Äù. I love these quarterly reports from Stericycle, and I think this one has some interesting bits worth highlighting.</p>

<p>In Q2 there were over <strong>80 times more FDA recalls</strong> (measured in ‚Äúunits‚Äù) and <strong>45 times more USDA recalls</strong> (measured in pounds) compared to Q1. The USDA recalled 1.1 million pounds in Q1, and a whopping <strong>53.3 million pounds in Q2</strong>. (I always appreciated the USDA‚Äôs use of mass compared to the FDA‚Äôs reliance on ‚Äúunits‚Äù).</p>

<p>Of the FDA recalls, there were more pathogen-related recalls than in any of the past two years. This could likely be a result of increased testing and a large number of recalls linked to past outbreaks thanks to whole genome sequencing.</p>

<p>The report also highlights the role played by the ‚Äúmultiplier effect‚Äù, which I have written about here. Their example of the <a href="http://scottlougheed.com/2016/05/10/may-official-listeria-monocytogenes-month/">sunflower seed recalls</a> that resulted in over <strong>600,000 units of product</strong> being recalled highlights this multiplier effect well. Not only were many brands of plain-ol‚Äô sunflower seeds affected, so were cereals, granola bars, and store-prepared salads. It was a mess. It shows one of the consequences of the immense consolidation and centralization of certain aspects of the food industry as well as just how serious ‚Äúingredient‚Äù recalls can be.</p>

<p>More recently, and not covered by the report, the recent <em>E. coli</em> contaminated flour recalls (see <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/08/baking-mixes-recalled-nationwide-because-of-e-coli-in-flour/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/07/more-sick-general-mills-recalls-more-flour-traced-to-outbreak/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/07/marie-callenders-recalls-biscuit-mix-with-general-mills-flour/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/07/fritters-recalled-breading-contains-flour-linked-to-outbreak/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/07/general-mills-flour-recall-causes-pancake-mix-recall/">here</a>, and the original recall <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm509693.htm">here</a>) demonstrates this phenomenon well. The spread of this recall across so many different brands and products is quite remarkable. The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm509693.htm">original recall</a> took place on July 1, and here we are 6 weeks later and we are <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/08/baking-mixes-recalled-nationwide-because-of-e-coli-in-flour/">still seeing recalls</a> related to this flour.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs shaping up to be an interesting year for recalls in the United States. Looking forward to Q3!</p>
