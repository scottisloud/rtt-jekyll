<p>I am a Sales Engineer on the Sales Enablement team at <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a>. Formerly I was a Customer Onboarding Specialist in Customer Success at 1Password.</p>

<h4 id="past-life">Past Life</h4>
<p>I am an environmental social scientist, though I am no longer employed in academia or as a researcher. Most recently I was a postdoctoral fellow in Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto. Prior to that I was a visiting scholar in the department of Agricultural Economics, Sociology, and Education at the Pennsylvania State University. I earned my PhD from the School of Environmental Studies at Queen’s University, Kingston. I also hold Master’s (Queen’s University) and Bachelor’s (University of Victoria) degrees in Sociology.</p>

<p>My primary interests lie in two domains: environmental governance, particularly with respect to waste and consumption; and the biopolitics of the food system.</p>

<p>I am also interested in the development of community and communal spaces. I am particularly interested in models of collective ownership and sharing as a means of reducing consumption (and thus, waste), community capacity-building and empowerment, and social justice.</p>

<h4 id="as-a-human">As a human:</h4>
<p>I am an enthusiastic cook and bread baker, a freelance sound engineer, and am slowly learning how to develop software.</p>
