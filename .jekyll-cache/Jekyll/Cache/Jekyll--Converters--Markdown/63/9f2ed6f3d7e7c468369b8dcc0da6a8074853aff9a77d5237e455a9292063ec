All of the recalled ground beef was produced on July 26. They all have the establishment number “EST. 337” printed inside the USDA mark or on the product packaging seam.

<p>Note that this 30 tons of beef in a single day of production. I have always been curious about the impact of production scale on the size of food recalls. Being able to narrow down the affected product to a specific day of production – or detect an issue and resolve it within a day – is fairly remarkable. However, if a single day of production is 30 tons of product, perhaps we need to narrow this window even further. Food processors are stunningly efficient at making massive quantities of product very quickly. It seems to me that there is a need to step up detection and traceability to keep pace.</p>
