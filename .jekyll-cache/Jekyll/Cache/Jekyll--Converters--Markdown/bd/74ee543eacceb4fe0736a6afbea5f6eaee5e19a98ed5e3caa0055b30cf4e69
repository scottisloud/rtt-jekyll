I"ù<p>My regular reader will have noticed recent change to the appearance of Recall These Thoughts. For the second time in one year Iâ€™ve changed blog platforms. You, dear reader, will likely remember the move away from Squarespace over to Wordpress. This was motivated as both a cost-saving measure and a way to gain a bit of additional flexibility. I love Squarespace, but a big part of having a blog for me is having a little toy to tinker with. Wordpress offered a bit more of that type of freedom.</p>
