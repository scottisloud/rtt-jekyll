I"à<p>A 98.7% compliance rate is fine. Thatâ€™s a great compliance rate. But it really obscures the deeper implications.</p>

<ol>
  <li>These tests have no real relationship to quantity of material that is in or out of compliance.</li>
  <li>Just because the probability of non-compliance (and by extension, contamination) is very low (1.3%) doesnâ€™t have any bearing on the potential consequences.</li>
</ol>

<p>As fatal, or at least monumental food recalls remind us every year or so, that 1.3% failure rate is much more important than the corresponding 98.7% success rate. It is worth noting that the 2011-2012 year to which these statistics correspond is the same year in which Canada experienced its largest recall in history.</p>
