I"c<p>Today during a listen-through of Jimmy Eat World’s discography (as I do with bands from time to time), it was time to listen to <em>Chase This Light</em> (2007), the band’s fifth record. <em>Chase This Light</em> had, for a decade, been the point at which Jimmy Eat World and I diverged. For years, as the band released new records, I had difficulty coming around to their evolving sound. While I continued to buy their subsequent records, none of them made it into high rotation even though I regularly revisited <em>Clarity</em> (1999), <em>Bleed American</em> (2001), and <em>Futures</em> (2004).</p>
