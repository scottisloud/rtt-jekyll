I&#8217;m pleased to announce the launch of Canada&#8217;s Waste Network. This is an initiative that intends to bring together researchers in Canada studying waste. It is a new and growing community and new resources and events will be added regularly. If you are a scholar at a Canadian institution doing research on waste (in Canada or abroad), I&#8217;d encourage you to become a member and connect with the community!
