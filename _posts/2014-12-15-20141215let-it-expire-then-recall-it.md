<span>Recent recall of ground beef for E. coli detected by Food Net, a federally coordinated group that is NOT responsible for enforcement of food safety. Despite the laboratory results from Food Net, it was several days until a recall was issued, and another day after that until it was made public. At that point, the implicated batches of beef had expired.&nbsp;</span>From CBC News:<figure>
