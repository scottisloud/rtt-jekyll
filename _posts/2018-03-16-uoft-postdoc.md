I am delighted to announce that as of March, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto](http://geography.utoronto.ca/profiles/scott-lougheed/).

I will be working with Virginia Maclaren on issues related to the role of the consumer under extended producer responsibility in Ontario.
